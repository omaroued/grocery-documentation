Go to images folder and replace `logo.png` with your logo (keep the same
name).
### App launcher icon
- After changing the app logo, run the following command:
 ```
 flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
 ```

### Splash Screen
1. Go to images folder and replace `logo_splash.png` with your logo (keep the same
name and the **recommended** image resolution is 300px*300px).

2. Go to `flutter_native_splash.yaml` and replace the background colors (default and dark mode) with yours:

![image alt text](/images/splash_screen.jpg)

3. For every logo or background change you have to run the following command:
```
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```
