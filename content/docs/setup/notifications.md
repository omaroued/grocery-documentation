For notifications between users and admin, we will use firebase messaging. So, we need the server key.

To get it, you have to go to Project settings → Cloud messaging and copy the server id then paste it in lib/helpers/project_configuration.dart.

## Android
To change notification icon, go to `android/app/src/main/res/drawable` and replace `notification_logo.png` with yours (keep same file name).

## IOS
1. Generate the certificates required by Apple for receiving push notifications following this [guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/certs) in the Firebase docs. You can skip the section titled `Create the Provisioning Profile`.
2. In Xcode, select Runner in the Project Navigator. In the `Capabilities` Tab turn on `Push Notifications` and `Background Mode`s, and enable `Background fetch` and `Remote notifications` under `Background Modes`.
